## Abstract
This work is titled 'Flora's Yonkoma'. A yonkoma is a four-panel comic that can run up and down or right to left. Yonkoma’s follow “kishōtenketsu”; The first panel sets the scene, the second adds development, the third is the climax, and the fourth shows the effects of the climax.

Figure 2. Flora's Yonkoma Iteration 1; This is the first iteration of the yonkoma comic, it outlines the rough sketches and idea for the main comic, as well as the layout. The comic is meant to be read as; 1. top right, 2. bottom right, 3. top left, 4. bottom left.

## Introduction and Related Works

The yonkoma I have made is a bit of a parody of a typical yonkoma. This yonkoma features my animated rabbit character, Flora Ven. Flora is a rabbit with multicolored flowers on her fur, and she gets into various different situations, usually of her own accord. In this comic she is seen drawing at a table. The first panel has her casually drawing at the table. In the second panel her drawing becomes more and more intense until in the third panel it appears she is almost battling the drawing itself, complete with comic speed lines and intense blur effects. At the end of the comic, she holds up her artwork exclaiming "I made a yonkoma". The artwork she is holding up ironically contains a smaller drawing of the comic itself, and within that drawing is a smaller drawing of the comic again. This would theoretically continue on into infinity if the viewer’s perception and digital painting software allowed it to. This is what’s referred to as a Droste Effect. It is named after the metal tins of cocoa of the Dutch chocolate maker, which contained a picture within a picture[2].

Figure 3. Flora's Yonkoma Iteration 2; This iteration emphasizes the comic art effects of speed lines for motion and cross hatching for shadows.

## Methodology

When starting this project, research was conducted into what a yonkoma is as well as various comic art styles and effects used in animation and comic strips. To start with, yonkomas are structured differently than your average comic strip. While western culture dictates that comic strips be read left-to-right, the formatting of a yonkoma dictates that it be read from top right down to the bottom right, then again from top left to the bottom left. With this in mind, I have formatted my yonkoma to adhere with these formatting rules, having the comic begin on the right and end on the left. Yonkomas also follows the 'kishōtenketsu' formatting in which 'the narrative unfolds with story elements whose interconnectedness becomes evident near the end of the story'[1].

Figure 4. Flora's Yonkoma Iteration 3; This iteration experiments with color and color theory. Warm colors are used to show agency while cool colors are used for calmness. Primary colors were used to give the piece a "pop art" type aesthetic.

Figure 5. Flora's Yonkoma Itteration 4; This iteration begins the process of adding Flora's flowers to her body. These flowers will then be duplicted and added to the subsequent smaller yonkoma. This process can sometimes be rather tedious.
